# Rider

This project aims to connect passengers with drivers. Passengers can create accounts, request rides, make payments, and receive invoices, while drivers can create accounts, accept ride requests, and complete trips. The system ensures that the entire process follows a seamless flowâ€”from ride requests to acceptance, execution, and completion. At the end of the trip, passengers can securely make payments and automatically receive their invoices.
